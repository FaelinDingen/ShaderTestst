**TDD HLSL**

***
For this assignment i will complete Freya Holmer’s shader tutorial series, 
culminating in the creation of a unique post-processing shader that goes beyond Shader Graph capabilities.
***
**Recources that i will be using.**
***
Unity - The engine that everything will be running in.
HLSL - The shading language that i will be using to create the shaders.
DataGrip - The IDE that i will be using. It has better support for HLSL than visual studio.
Freya Holmer's Introduction to HLSL tutorial series - The best introduction you can have to HLSL.
