**FDD HLSL**

***
For this project i will be learning more about HLSL or high level shading language.

I will be continuing the tutorials of Freya Holmer which are about 4 hours each and take about 20 hours each to complete realistically speaking.

The upcoming videos are going to be about Healthbars, SDF's (signed distance fields), Lighting, Normal maps, Tangent space and IBL.
I also really want to make a post-processing shader that does something cool that you cant do with shader graph.
this will be my final challenge to see if i can put the stuff i learnt to good use.

Must Have: Finished all the tutorials. And have results to show for it.

o

Should have: A working post-processing shader that isn;t from the tutorial series.

Could have: Watched the math for game developers tutorial series also from Freya Holmer.

o

Won't have: Not finished the shader tutorial series.
